Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

Issue Summary:

Duration: Start Time: January 18, 2024, 03:45 AM UTC | End Time: January 18, 2024, 06:30 AM UTC
Impact: The outage affected our main web application, resulting in a 30% user base unable to access the service. Users experienced slow page loads and intermittent errors during the incident.
Timeline:

Detection Time: January 18, 2024, 03:45 AM UTC

Detection Method: Monitoring alert triggered due to a sudden spike in HTTP 500 errors.

Actions Taken:

03:50 AM UTC: Engineering team alerted and began initial investigation.
04:00 AM UTC: Assumed it might be a database issue, focused on database server logs.
04:30 AM UTC: No issues found in the database logs; expanded the investigation to load balancers and application servers.
05:00 AM UTC: Misleading assumption that the issue might be related to a recent code deployment; rolled back changes, but the problem persisted.
05:30 AM UTC: Escalated incident to senior engineering team and infrastructure team.
Resolution:

06:00 AM UTC: Discovered that a misconfigured network switch was causing intermittent packet loss between the load balancer and application servers.
06:30 AM UTC: Network switch reconfigured, restoring normal traffic flow and resolving the issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfigured network switch led to packet loss, resulting in communication issues between the load balancer and application servers.
Resolution: Reconfiguration of the network switch settings to ensure proper packet forwarding and eliminate packet loss.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Network Monitoring: Enhance monitoring on critical network components to detect issues proactively.
Documentation: Improve documentation for network configurations and ensure all team members are familiar with the network topology.
Incident Response Training: Conduct training sessions to help the team recognize and troubleshoot network-related issues effectively.
Tasks:

Implement Network Redundancy: Evaluate the possibility of introducing redundancy in critical network components to minimize the impact of single points of failure.
Automated Alerts: Set up automated alerts for abnormal network behavior, such as packet loss or latency spikes.
Regular Audits: Schedule regular audits of network configurations to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations before they lead to outages.
Communication Protocols: Establish clear communication protocols for incident escalation to ensure timely resolution.
Post-Incident Review: Conduct a detailed post-incident review with the team to identify lessons learned and areas for further improvement.
This postmortem highlights the importance of comprehensive monitoring, quick and accurate diagnosis, and collaborative problem-solving during web stack outages. By implementing these corrective measures, we aim to enhance our system's resilience and prevent similar incidents in the future.
